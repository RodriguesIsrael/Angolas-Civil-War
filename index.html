                   For twenty-seven years, from 1975 to 2002, the Angolan civil war  the most <p><p> destructive of its era, where ideo-
                   ogical and ethnic rivals fought for control,<p><p> sustained by foreign sponsors. The onlywar of the era that matched
                   its <p><p>destructiveness was the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.<p><br>
               <p>
                   For seventeen years, 1972-1992, the Angola war quickly escalated into one <p><p> of the most dangerous
                   confrontations of the late Cold War, as the Soviet Union <p><p> backed its ideological allies and
                   brought a large, proxy military force from Cuba <p><p> to fight with them. Officially racist (Apartheid)
                   South Africa, threatened by chaos <p><p> and Soviet presence to its north, rushed in to support the
                   rival side, with quiet <p><p> assistance from the United States, also anxious to balance the expansion of
                   Soviet influence.When the war ended, an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 Angolans had <p><p> been killed, hundreds of
                   thousands maimed, and 4 million had lost their homes and livelihoods. The Angolan civil war, 1980s.

               <p>
                   Initially stymied by American vetoes in the 1970s and early 1980s, the United <p><p> Nations Security Council negotiated a series
                   of resolutions to resolve the war. <p><p> These led to negotiations of international peacekeeping forces, culminating
                   the <p><p> settlement  of the conflict. The war slowed after 1992, but a template for African <p><p> rebellion, strongman leadership and civil
                   war had been demonstrated. <p><p>Similar wars would engulf Central North and West Africa, leaving the continent overwhelmed by civil
                   war. If only the Angolan civil war had been resolved sooner, <p></p> the post-colonial history of the continent might have been much different.

                  The body: In this simulation, participants meet in the initial governing cabinet of the <p><p> newly independent state of Angola, where they aim to
                  build a country, while advancing <p><p>the interest of their own ethnic groups and factions, as well as their personal interests. <p><p>Which leader and group
                  will emerge triumphant cannot be known, nor can the impli- <p><p>cations for the other countries in southern Africa, the regional role of apartheid
                  South <p><p>Africa, global competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, or the globa influence of Cuba.

                  The following history presents events as they happened, in the most violent period of the <p><p>
                  Angolan civil war, 1975-92. Modest changes might have led to radically different outcomes.
                  Playing the characters described at the end of this issue brief, simulation participants will find
                  opportunity and alternatives much as their real counterparts did, with possibilities to transform
                  the Cold War, Angolan and world history.

                <p>
                   The overthrow of Portugal’s Prime Minister, Marcello Caetano, on 25 April 1974 hailed <p><p> a watershed moment for the former Portuguese
                   colonies of Mozambique, Guinea Bissau,<p><p>Cape Verde, São Tomé and Principe and Angola. The Armed Forces Movement (AFM) <p><p>had
                   overthrown the dictatorship in a mostly bloodless coup, thereby ending Portuguese colonial rule in Africa.</p><br>
                <p>
                <p>
                    Thus, Angola attained official independence on 11 November 1975 and, while the stage <p><p> was set for transition, a combination of ethnic tensions
                    and international pressures rende- <p><p>red Angola’s hard-won victory problematic. As with many post-colonial states, Angola <p><p>was left with both
                    economic and social difficulties which translated into a power struggle between the three predominant liberation movements. Three rebel
                    movements inher ited <p><p>the  new country. When the original power-sharing agreement between the three groups collapsed in 1975, the country
                    collapsed into ca tastrophic civil war, made worse by <p><p>ethnic hatred and foreign intervention
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), formed in December of <p><p>1956 as an offshoot of the Angolan Communist Party,
                    had as its support base the Ambu-<p><p>ndu (or Kimbundu) people and was largely supported by other African countries, Cuba <p><p>and the Soviet
                    Union. The National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), founded in 1962,<p><p> was rooted among  the Bakongo (or Kongo) people and strongly
                    supported the restoration <p><p> and defense of the Kongo empire, eventually developing into anationalist movement supported by the
                    government of Zaire and (initially) the People’s Republic owf China. <p><p> The Ovimbundu people formed the base of the
                    National Union for the Total Indepen-<p></p>dence of Angola (UNITA), hich was established in 1966 and founded by a prominent <p><p>Jonas Savimbi,
                    formerly a leader of the FNLA. UNITA was supported by South Africa <p><p>and the United States.

                    Ethnic Tensions: A salient reason for the continuation of civil war after independence <p><p> was a result of the reluctance of the dominant
                    liberation movements to share power <p><p>within a multi-ethnic society. Unlike former Portuguese colonies, the Angolan people <p><p>fought their
                    colonizers on three fronts. The MPLA called for a single united front of all <p><p>anti-colonial Angolan forces, however its popular appeal
                    was largely limited to the <p><p> Mbundu – Angola’s second largest ethnic group – and the multiracial Mestiqos. <p><p>The MPLA’s nationalist drive
                    did not appeal to the Bakongo people, who rallied to <p><p>militant right-wing FNLA leader, Holden Roberto’s, call for the reestablishment 
                    of the ancient Kingdom of Kongo in the north of Angola. FNLA supporters were largely rural <p><p> and remained separated from colonial society,
                    but suffered extensively from land dispossession under colonial authorities in the 1950s.
