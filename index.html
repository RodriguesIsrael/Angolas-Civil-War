               For twenty-seven years, from 1975 to 2002, the Angolan civil war the most destructive of its era, where ideo-
               ogical and ethnic rivals fought for control,sustained by foreign sponsors. The onlywar of the era that matched
               its destructiveness was the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.<p><br>
            <p>
               For seventeen years, 1972-1992, the Angola war quickly escalated into one of the most dangerous
               confrontations of the late Cold War, as the Soviet Union backed its ideological allies and
               brought a large, proxy military force from Cuba  to fight with them. Officially racist (Apartheid)
               South Africa, threatened by chaos and Soviet presence to its north, rushed in to support the
               rival side, with quiet assistance from the United States, also anxious to balance the expansion of
               Soviet influence.When the war ended, an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 Angolans had been killed, hundreds of
               thousands maimed, and 4 million had lost their homes and livelihoods. The Angolan civil war, 1980s.

               Initially stymied by American vetoes in the 1970s and early 1980s, the United Nations Security Council negotiated a series
               of resolutions to resolve the war.These led to negotiations of international peacekeeping forces, culminating
               the settlement of the conflict. The war slowed after 1992, but a template for African rebellion, strongman leadership and civil
               war had been demonstrated. Similar wars would engulf Central North and West Africa, leaving the continent overwhelmed by civil
               war. If only the Angolan civil war had been resolved sooner, the post-colonial history of the continent might have been much different.

               The body: In this simulation, participants meet in the initial governing cabinet of the  newly independent state of Angola, where they aim to
               build a country, while advancing the interest of their own ethnic groups and factions, as well as their personal interests. Which leader and group
               will emerge triumphant cannot be known, nor can the implications for the other countries in southern Africa, the regional role of apartheid
               South Africa, global competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, or the globa influence of Cuba.

             <p>
                The overthrow of Portugal’s Prime Minister, Marcello Caetano, on 25 April 1974 hailed  a watershed moment for the former Portuguese
                colonies of Mozambique, Guinea Bissau,Cape Verde, São Tomé and Principe and Angola. The Armed Forces Movement (AFM) had
                overthrown the dictatorship in a mostly bloodless coup, thereby ending Portuguese colonial rule in Africa.

                Thus, Angola attained official independence on 11 November 1975 and, while the stage was set for transition, a combination of ethnic tensions
                and international pressures rendered Angola’s hard-won victory problematic. As with many post-colonial states, Angola was left with both
                economic and social difficulties which translated into a power struggle between the three predominant liberation movements. Three rebel
                movements inher ited the new country. When the original power-sharing agreement between the three groups collapsed in 1975, the country
                collapsed into ca tastrophic civil war, made worse by ethnic hatred and foreign intervention

                The People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), formed in December of 1956 as an offshoot of the Angolan Communist Party,
                had as its support base the Ambundu (or Kimbundu) people and was largely supported by other African countries, Cuba and the Soviet
                Union. The National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), founded in 1962,was rooted among the Bakongo (or Kongo) people and strongly
                supported the restoration and defense of the Kongo empire, eventually developing into anationalist movement supported by the
                government of Zaire and (initially) the People’s Republic owf China. The Ovimbundu people formed the base of National Union for the 
                Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), hich was established in 1966 and founded by a prominent Jonas Savimbi,
                formerly a leader of the FNLA. UNITA was supported by South Africa and the United States.
