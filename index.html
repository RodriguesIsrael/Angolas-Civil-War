            <h1> Introduction </h1><br>
            <p>
                For twenty-seven years, from 1975 to 2002, the Angolan civil war the most destructive of its era, where
                ideo-
                ogical and ethnic rivals fought for control,sustained by foreign sponsors. The onlywar of the era that
                matched
                its destructiveness was the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.
            <p><br>
            <p>
                For seventeen years, 1972-1992, the Angola war quickly escalated into one of the most dangerous
                confrontations of the late Cold War, as the Soviet Union backed its ideological allies and
                brought a large, proxy military force from Cuba to fight with them. Officially racist (Apartheid)
                South Africa, threatened by chaos and Soviet presence to its north, rushed in to support the
                rival side, with quiet assistance from the United States, also anxious to balance the expansion of
                Soviet influence.When the war ended, an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 Angolans had been killed, hundreds
                of
                thousands maimed, and 4 million had lost their homes and livelihoods. The Angolan civil war, 1980s.

                Initially stymied by American vetoes in the 1970s and early 1980s, the United Nations Security Council
                negotiated a series
                of resolutions to resolve the war.These led to negotiations of international peacekeeping forces,
                culminating
                the settlement of the conflict. The war slowed after 1992, but a template for African rebellion,
                strongman leadership and civil
                war had been demonstrated.

            <h1>Independence to Civil War </h1><br>
            <p>
                The overthrow of Portugal’s Prime Minister, Marcello Caetano, on 25 April 1974 hailed a watershed moment
                for the former Portuguese
                colonies of Mozambique, Guinea Bissau,Cape Verde, São Tomé and Principe and Angola. The Armed Forces
                Movement (AFM) had
                overthrown the dictatorship in a mostly bloodless coup, thereby ending Portuguese colonial rule in
                Africa.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Thus, Angola attained official independence on 11 November 1975 and, while the stage was set for
                transition, a combination of ethnic tensions
                and international pressures rendered Angola’s hard-won victory problematic. As with many post-colonial
                states, Angola was left with both
                economic and social difficulties which translated into a power struggle between the three predominant
                liberation movements. Three rebel
                movements inher ited the new country. When the original power-sharing agreement between the three groups
                collapsed in 1975, the country
                collapsed into ca tastrophic civil war, made worse by ethnic hatred and foreign intervention
            </p><br>

                The People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), formed in December of 1956 as an offshoot of
                the Angolan Communist Party,
                had as its support base the Ambundu (or Kimbundu) people and was largely supported by other African
                countries, Cuba and the Soviet
                Union.
