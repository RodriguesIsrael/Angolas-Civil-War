        <p>This is a project that was developed by me. The aim of the project is to inform and educate
           readers and visitors to the page about the impact that civil war has on society. In the 
           country where I was born, the civil war lasted 27 years, having devastated society and destroyed
           lives and separated entire families and resulted in thousands of deaths, I am one of the survivors 
           of this evil and terrible Angolan civil war that started in the 70s and ended in 2002 , having been
           born in 1985, this means that I was born in the middle of the crossfire, having my dreams destroyed 
           and my future</p></b>
           Today we face scenarios not of civil war, but of aggressive invasion of one country against another,
           like the war in Ukraine, Iraq, Libya, etc.The reasons for war most of the times are mainly due to the
           excessive ambition of individuals or countries, which use their economic and military power to humiliate 
           other countries, but in my country the issue was a little different. Because there are 3 liberation movements
           in Angola that fought against colonialism, which after independence wanted to divide the country into three states, 
           which left the MPLA party, which had Soviet support disgruntled, thus launching waves of attacks in the capital of 
           Angola - Luanda against other parties, such as the FNLA and UNITA, pushing these parties into the woods and forest,
           thus starting a war that would last 27 years.There is no peace without consensus on crucial and vital points for the
           well-being of a society or group of men. This project also aims to give the reader or researcher a broad view of the
           recurrent problems not only in Angola but also in Africa in general, as I noticed that many people from America, Asia
           and Europe have little knowledge of the real history of Africa. With this history of Angola's civil war, I believe that
           many will seek to know more about other countries and learn more about their histories and cultures.</p>
