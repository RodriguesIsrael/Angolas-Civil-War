            <h1> A Brief Account of the Conflict </h1><br>
            <p>Subsequent to the Portuguese withdrawal from Angola, the Cuban- and Soviet-backed MPLA
                had secured control of Luanda – Angola’s capital city – and declared itself as the new
                government of independent Angola. Bolstering its position was the fact that it had received
                support and recognition from several other African countries; in 1969 the Organization for
                African Unity (OAU) referred to the MPLA as the only truly representative party of Angola,
                and in 1976 the MPLA was formally recognized by the OAU as the legitimate government of
                independent Angola. The period between 1975 and 1976 was characterized not only by the
                withdrawal of the Portuguese, but also by the arrival of Cuban forces and the South African
                invasion into Luanda. Additionally, this period saw the defeat of the FNLA and the rise of
                UNITA as challengers to the MPLA’s selfestablished rule. </p><br>
            <p>
                Subsequent to the Portuguese coup the FNLA’s internal support had already deteriorated
                considerably, although it maintained steady relations with Zaire and was thus well armed.
                This led the FNLA to attempt a forceful overthrow of the MPLA in Luanda, although the
                MPLA, backed by Cuba and the Soviet Union, deflected the onslaught and subsequently turned
                their antagonism towards UNITA. While the weakest in terms of military strength, UNITA
                harbored the greatest potential for electoral support, thus threatening the MPLA’s position
                of power. The FNLA and UNITA established a rival government in Huambo, pleading
                assistance from the South African forces to aid in ousting the MPLA.  <a
